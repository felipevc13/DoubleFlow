# Project Brief

## Core Requirements & Goals

- **Objective:** To create an intelligent task management application that leverages AI to assist users in organizing, refining, and potentially automating tasks and workflows.
- **Key Features:**
  - Task creation, listing, and management.
  - Visual task flow editor (using Vue Flow).
  - AI-powered task refinement/generation (using Google Generative AI).
  - Knowledge base integration.
  - Data source integration (handling text, Excel files).
  - Survey creation and management.
  - User authentication (likely via Supabase).
- **Target Audience:** Individuals or teams looking for a smarter way to manage tasks and projects, potentially leveraging AI for assistance.
- **Scope:** Development of the Nuxt 3 frontend application, server API endpoints for AI and file processing, and integration with Supabase for data persistence and authentication.
- **Success Metrics:** User adoption, successful task management, effective AI assistance, stable performance.

## Project Background

- **Context:** Need for a more dynamic and intelligent task management tool compared to traditional list-based apps. Desire to integrate AI capabilities directly into the workflow.
- **Related Systems:** None explicitly mentioned, but competes with existing task managers and workflow tools.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- **Assumptions:** Users have tasks/workflows they want to manage. Users are open to AI assistance. Supabase provides sufficient backend capabilities. Google Generative AI meets the AI requirements.
- **Constraints:** Relies on external services (Supabase, Google AI). Development time/resources. Specific browser compatibility might be limited by dependencies like Vue Flow.
